# Migrated Components Manifest

This file tracks components that have already been migrated as part of a page migration.

- components/PostFeed.tsx
- components/Loader.tsx
- components/PostList.tsx
- components/HorizontalScrollTech.tsx
- components/Metatags.tsx

Policy:
- Migrate a component on the first page that requires it.
- Add its path below so subsequent page migrations skip re-migrating it.

Example:
- components/AwesomeNavBar.tsx
