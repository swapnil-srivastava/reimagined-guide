# Favorites Feature Implementation

This document describes the implementation of the products favorites feature.

## Current Status

- ✅ Frontend components have been implemented
- ✅ TypeScript interfaces have been added
- ✅ API endpoints have been created
- ✅ Database types have been updated in `database.types.ts`
- ❌ Database table needs to be created in Supabase
- ✅ Fixed UI issue with duplicate navigation bar and footer

## UI Issues Fixed

We identified and fixed an issue with the favorites page having duplicate navigation bars and footers. This was caused by:
1. The `_app.tsx` file wrapping all pages with a navigation bar and footer
2. The `/pages/favorites/index.tsx` also including its own navigation bar and footer

We removed the duplicated components from the favorites page to fix this issue.

## Database Schema

Create a new `favorites` table in your Supabase database using this migration:

```sql
-- Create favorites table for products
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS favorites (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  user_id UUID NOT NULL,
  product_id UUID NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  
  -- Add foreign key constraints
  CONSTRAINT fk_user
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id)
    REFERENCES auth.users(id)
    ON DELETE CASCADE,
    
  CONSTRAINT fk_product
    FOREIGN KEY (product_id)
    REFERENCES products(id)
    ON DELETE CASCADE,
    
  -- Ensure a user can only favorite a product once
  CONSTRAINT unique_user_product UNIQUE (user_id, product_id)
);

-- Add RLS (Row Level Security) policies
ALTER TABLE favorites ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Allow users to view their own favorites
CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own favorites" ON favorites
  FOR SELECT
  USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Allow authenticated users to insert their own favorites
CREATE POLICY "Users can insert their own favorites" ON favorites
  FOR INSERT
  WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Allow users to delete their own favorites
CREATE POLICY "Users can delete their own favorites" ON favorites
  FOR DELETE
  USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Add indexes for faster queries
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_favorites_user_id ON favorites(user_id);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_favorites_product_id ON favorites(product_id);
```

## Current Implementation

Your codebase already has a partially implemented favorites feature:

1. **Components**
   - `/components/ProductHeartButton.tsx`: Button to add/remove favorites (already implemented)
   - This component already has the UI and functionality to add/remove items from favorites

## Files We've Created/Modified

1. **Types & Interfaces**
   - `/lib/interfaces/favorite.interface.ts`: Defines the Favorite interface

2. **API Endpoints**
   - `/pages/api/favorites.ts`: Backend API for CRUD operations

3. **React Hooks**
   - `/lib/product/use-favorites.ts`: Hook for managing favorites

4. **Components**
   - `/components/FavoriteButton.tsx`: Alternative button to add/remove favorites
   - `/components/ProductCardWithFavorites.tsx`: Extended ProductCard with favorites functionality

5. **Pages**
   - `/pages/favorites/index.tsx`: Page to display user's favorites

6. **Navigation**
   - Updated `/components/AwesomeNavBar.tsx` to include a favorites link

## How to Use

1. Apply the migration in your Supabase project to create the `favorites` table
2. Update your database.types.ts file to include the favorites table
3. Test adding/removing favorites using the existing heart button on product cards
4. Navigate to the Favorites page via the dropdown menu

## Update database.types.ts

✅ COMPLETED: We've already updated the `database.types.ts` file to include the favorites table definition. You don't need to do this step manually.

## Verification Steps

After creating the favorites table, verify the implementation:

1. Log in to your account
2. Navigate to the products page
3. Click on the heart icon on a product to add it to favorites
4. Visit the favorites page to see your saved products
5. Test removing products from favorites

## Features Implemented

1. **Add to Favorites**: Users can add products to their favorites by clicking the heart icon
2. **Remove from Favorites**: Users can remove products from their favorites
3. **Favorites Page**: Users can view all their favorited products
4. **Pagination**: The favorites page includes pagination for better navigation
5. **Loading States**: Skeleton loaders for improved user experience
6. **Empty State**: Friendly message when no favorites exist

    id: string;
