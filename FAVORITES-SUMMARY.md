# Favorites Feature Implementation Summary

I've completed the implementation of the favorites feature for your e-commerce app. Here's a summary of what was done:

## What I've Discovered

1. Your codebase already had a `ProductHeartButton.tsx` component that handles adding/removing products from favorites.
2. However, the `favorites` table doesn't exist in your Supabase database yet.

## What I've Created

1. **Database Migration**
   - Created a migration file at `supabase/migrations/20231025000000_create_favorites_table.sql`
   - This file has all the SQL needed to create the favorites table with proper constraints

2. **Favorites Page**
   - Created a dedicated page to view all favorited products at `/pages/favorites/index.tsx`
   - This page displays all products a user has marked as favorite

3. **Navigation**
   - Added a favorites link to the dropdown menu in your navbar

4. **API Endpoint**
   - Created a backend API at `/pages/api/favorites.ts` to handle favorites operations
   - This provides GET, POST, and DELETE operations for favorites

5. **Types & Hooks**
   - Created types in `/lib/interfaces/favorite.interface.ts`
   - Created a custom hook in `/lib/product/use-favorites.ts` to manage favorites state

6. **Documentation**
   - Created `FAVORITES-README.md` with detailed instructions

## Next Steps

1. **Apply the database migration** to create the `favorites` table in Supabase
2. **Update your database.types.ts** file to include the favorites table definition
3. **Test the feature** by:
   - Adding products to favorites using the heart button
   - Viewing your favorites on the favorites page
   - Removing products from favorites

The feature is fully integrated with your existing UI and follows your application's design patterns and internationalization setup.
