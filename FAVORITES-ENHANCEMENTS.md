## 7. Implementation Guide

### Database Migration
```sql
-- Create favorites table for products
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS favorites (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  user_id UUID NOT NULL,
  product_id UUID NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  
  -- Add foreign key constraints
  CONSTRAINT fk_user
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id)
    REFERENCES auth.users(id)
    ON DELETE CASCADE,
    
  CONSTRAINT fk_product
    FOREIGN KEY (product_id)
    REFERENCES products(id)
    ON DELETE CASCADE,
    
  -- Ensure a user can only favorite a product once
  CONSTRAINT unique_user_product UNIQUE (user_id, product_id)
);

-- Add RLS (Row Level Security) policies
ALTER TABLE favorites ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Allow users to view their own favorites
CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own favorites" ON favorites
  FOR SELECT
  USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Allow authenticated users to insert their own favorites
CREATE POLICY "Users can insert their own favorites" ON favorites
  FOR INSERT
  WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Allow users to delete their own favorites
CREATE POLICY "Users can delete their own favorites" ON favorites
  FOR DELETE
  USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Add indexes for faster queries
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_favorites_user_id ON favorites(user_id);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_favorites_product_id ON favorites(product_id);
```

### Database Types Update
Update your `database.types.ts` file to include:

```typescript
favorites: {
  Row: {
    id: string;
    user_id: string;
    product_id: string;
    created_at: string;
  };
  Insert: {
    id?: string;
    user_id: string;
    product_id: string;
    created_at?: string;
  };
  Update: {
    id?: string;
    user_id?: string;
    product_id?: string;
    created_at?: string;
  };
  Relationships: [
    {
      foreignKeyName: "fk_user";
      columns: ["user_id"];
      referencedRelation: "users";
      referencedColumns: ["id"];
    },
    {
      foreignKeyName: "fk_product";
      columns: ["product_id"];
      referencedRelation: "products";
      referencedColumns: ["id"];
    }
  ];
}
```
